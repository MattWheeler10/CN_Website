    <h2 class="headings">About me and why I chose Code Nation:</h2>
    <p class="text">I am a junior developer who has a passion for computers, coding and IT in general. I studied computer science for two years learning about hardware, software, the history of computers as well as IT law. I especially enjoyed the coding aspect of the course; we built a dice game in python as coursework where we had to plan, create and evaluate a complex program - it was a great experience and I learnt valuable lessons in teamwork, project management and of course, coding. I chose code nation because I was inspired by the idea of an apprenticeship in the tech field; the perfect environment for me to meet like-minded souls and pursue my passion for problem solving and software development.
