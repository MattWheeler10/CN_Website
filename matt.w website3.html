    <h2 class="headings">3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams? 
        </h2>
        <p class="text">When using the IT tools and systems i realized that there are multiple benefits and also drawbacks in terms of productivity and efficiency. Trello has a huge benefit to make teamworking a lot more efficient. When a trello board is created you can invite fellow team members so that you can all see the plan of action and edit it whenever the board automatically updates when something is written meaning that everyone on the trello page can see new ideas as soon as they are saved which is a very useful way of increasing productivity.

    <h2 class="headings">3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency 
        </h2>
        <p class="text">Having a good schedule is a very good way of improving productivity plan out what you want to accomplish in the day and arrange breaks so that you are always working efficiently. Make sure your instructions are clear and concise to ensure no time is wasted on anything irrelevant to the task in hand.
            </p>
    <h2 class="headings">3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?</h2>
        <p class="text">A huge aspect of improving my productivity when using IT would be to insure i had better hardware so that no time is wasted on waiting for laptops to charge i would consider using desktop pc’s or longer lasting laptops that last the whole day. I feel that i used slack in a positive and productive way and it helped communicate and share information with peers. In the future I would consider working in a team if the task was similar as many of the people I have given advice to and received advice from where also very good at the project and i could see us working in a team to produce something much better than all of are individual websites we could use applications such as slack and trello to assist our communication and to share information.</p>
    <h2 class="headings">3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h2>
        <p class="text">I would test my digital solution by putting the website or digital solution live on the internet and putting links to it on applications such as git hub so that i could have people use it and give feedback in order for me to improve the solution. I would also get friends and family to test it and if something is wrong I would quickly hear about it faster than if I just tried finding any errors. It is very important to test your digital solution because the last thing you want is to release it and then let all the users run into an error.
