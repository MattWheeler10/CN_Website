    <h2 class="headings">1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page 
        </h2>
    <p class="text">All five of my pages follow a similar layout and theme they all have the same background and the headings, text and titles are all the same colour and font throughout the pages. I wanted this simplistic style because it looks clean and modern. My website has buttons that allow you to seamlessly flow through the pages they look great and are very easy to use. I created a logo to put in the top left to make the website more professional and the tab logo also has this image on it. The first/home page has a single paragraph about me, it is a nice opener and you can then move to any unit and outcome you want. On all the other pages the unit and outcome is displayed as a title and the questions follow, their answers are directly underneath. At the bottom of each page is a code nation logo which if clicked sends you  to the we are code nation website; there is also an easter egg on the last page with a hidden secret.</p>
    <h2 class="headings">1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites 
        </h2>
    <p class="text">When creating a website one of the biggest things to be concerned about i the copyright act! Copyright denies you access to other people's words, images, videos   and even colours. The act allows authors and artists the exclusive rights to reproduce, distribute and display their works. The easiest way to avoid copyright is to simply use original content only and only use things of of the internet if they are clearly non copyright. Content without the copyright symbol are still protected by the act so do ensure your not using anything that specifically does not say non copyright.
    Another constraint is the data protection act which has been spoken about in unit 1, outcome 1. Another law that needs to be followed is the computer misuse act, this defines and criminalises a number of offences involving the use of a computer. This is why it is very serious if an individual is hacking or similar offences as it is criminal and it can result in you getting into serious trouble.

    <h2 class="headings">1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using web pages and how we can overcome them 
        </h2>
    <p class="text">When making a website you want it to be accessible by almost everyone and so it is important to include features that make it easier whether it is as simple as having subtitles on a video or more complex, for example having a narrator so that blind people or visually impared users can use your website as well. A colour blind mode could also be included to help people who are colour blind. By making your website simple and easy to read and use is also an effective way of helping people with mental issues confusing fonts and colours can make it hard for these individuals to understand so making a website simplistic is often important to include anyone who wants to use your website.

    <h2 class="headings">1.7 Describe which are the appropriate file types for websites
        </h2>
    <p class="text">There are many different  file types which can be used when creating your website but a lot of them are used for certain things such as: .avi this stands for audio/video interleaved and this file type is a video format supported by windows you have to download the file before you can watch any of it. .CSS is an example of what i have used css files are a tool to take care of what your website looks like. .EXE stands for EXEcutable file these file types are often used when downloading large files off of the internet. .GIF is the most common image format on the internet. It's great for simple images. .HTML is predominantly what i have been using for my website it creates the backbone of a website the text, images and pages. There are many more file types and some other popular ones are .JPG, .MIDI, .MP3, .MPEG, .MOV, .PDF, .PNG, .RAM, .RAR, .TIFF, .TXT, .WAV and .ZIP!
