    <h2 class="headings">1.1:describe the purpose of IT in modern business</h2>
    <p class="text">IT is essential in today's day and age, companies only function due to IT supporting them - whether a business uses a computer to store data or whether a business is based entirely on a website. Due to everyone needing IT in their business there is a huge gap in the market for skilled technicians to manage, create and protect the technology upon which the business depends. IT is also essential to protect confidential data and executive decisions to ensure company competitors cant access private information. Ultimately, IT  makes businesses so much more effective in what they do no matter what they do.

    <h2 class="headings">1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills?</h2>
    <p class="text">There are many methods of using technology to complete digital projects more effectively; number one is planning. Planning is essential in any type of project and with technology planning is simplified and improved, especially when in a team. Applications such as trello, slack and github are very effective to communicate, share files and manage time and tasks. These make a project so much easier plan and design than it would normally be. What's more these applications are very user friendly they don't require technical skill and they are free. In order to complete the task in hand you need the hardware first, if you need a powerful PC to do the task more money should be spent but if it doesn't require a powerful computer you can spend less. Laptops are a good idea as they are very portable and easy and efficient to use. When doing coursework at code nation I used a thinkpad laptop which was very good apart from the battery life so maybe consider ways to charge your device. If your digital project requires technicians of particularly high skill then these  isses often become more complex but the previous advice is still useful.

    <h2 class="headings">1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your Trello board. 
        </h2>
    <p class="text">As mentioned in the previous question, planning is very important and there are many different ways to plan or not plan at all. When planning i find Trello a very useful app to use ‘kanban’ (which by the way, is a Japanese word that means 'board' or 'sign') is an effective way of using and managing your tasks, it is where you have three different sections: things to do, doing and done, this is a good way to organise your planning and it keeps it neat and easy to understand for non-team members. Trello can be used for big projects in a work space or simple life tasks such as planning a wedding.when using trello for this project the first thing I did was to list all the individual tasks. I needed to do a section and then to move them along and add things on as i do them which helps me visualize every little task I needed to do so that I would not forget a single task.</p>

    <h2 class="headings">1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital
    projects to fail? Why?
        </h2>
        <p class="text">IT isnt 100% reliable and using technology can have some negative effects and carries risk. Hacking is a huge issue in the IT ecosystem and if you are subject to a hack in the middle of a digital project it can sabotage the whole thing or cause enormous financial burden. Another thing to look out for are viruses as they can slow down or even disable your laptop or pc, making it hard to continue with your project. Beyond that, a common cause  of project failure is if the people doing the work don't have the correct knowledge/ skill to complete it as many projects may have difficult  aspects that need to be taught to you such as new languages or frameworks, for example Vue.js; a very popular language that is relatively new and combines html, css and javascript in one neat little package. This is why it is essential to have a good team who are qualified in different areas E.G. Project manager and coder. Another problem is overambition and this often occurs when a team expects too much of themselves and they therefore under achieve which is why it is important to be realistic when planning a project.

    <h2 class="headings">1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job? 
        </h2>
        <p class="text">It is very important that you use good software and computers - as such when selecting the  equipment you must do lots of research and understand what is best for the task at hand. Some jobs only require basic equipment because the software being used may not require a powerful computer but if the software being used requires powerful computers it is worth spending more in order to be more effective. Research can be done to find the best software to use and some basic advice would be to look at what other teams or companies who are doing similar projects are using and bear in mind how reliable the software is.
        </p>
    <h2 class="headings">1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. – How has Trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control</h2>
    <p class="text"> The thinkpad has been a powerful asset in my latest coding exploits. I have personally crafted several programs, a blackjack game, a game of tic tac toe, a fully functional adventure game and a website. The compact functionality allowed me to easily share my screen with my fellow teammates nearby and apps such as Slack, Trello, Github have allowed me to communicate remotely from my personal computer.
        
    Trello was our primary digital coordinator for the adventure game and helped us manage our project so that each member of the team had clear instructions and could participate to their full potential. This was my first time using Trello and I found the functionality and convenience of the app refreshing and exciting when I consider the possibilities that could emerge working with a team of 20, 50 or even 100 people. 

    Git and Github would undeniably increase productivity as when coding the adventure game my team and I encountered issues when adding certain functions that damaged the integrity of the whole program, forcing to take future precautions by saving multiple copies of the file. Git would allow us to avoid such unecessary hassle with their version control system and the repository would make it easy for me to publish my work and display a portfolio of the projects I have completed so far as well as the many that I will no doubt finish in the future. </p>
    <h2 class="headings">1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects? 
        </h2>
        <p class="text">When doing a digital project legal guidelines are very important and must be followed allow this can limit some projects it keeps people safe on the internet. GDPR ensures that you can not obtain certain information from people and limits how long you can keep certain data these constraints can often impact a digital project as you may not legally be aloud to do certain things with people's information.</p>
