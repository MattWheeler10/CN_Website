    <h2 class="headings">2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello 
        </h2>
        <p class="text">Whilst designing and creating my website I have constantly used two main IT tools i have learnt alot about both of the softwares and they have both been very useful visual studio code is where i did all of my coding for the website is very user friendly and helps you with a lot of little things like auto typing in the correct syntax for giving suggestions on what to write next. The application combines lots of languages into one and I could therefore use HTML and CSS in the same application and easily combine them to create a fully functional and good looking website. The other tool I used was trelloit helped me plan out the whole project it also has some useful features such as adding colored tabs to help organise sections and an easy way of dragging tasks from to do, doing and done. Overall I felt that the IT tools I used throughout my project were very useful and perfect for what I was doing.
            </p>
    <h2 class="headings">2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello 
        </h2>
        <p class="text">I felt that Visual Studio code was very appropriate for the task in hand we needed a program that combines the two languages of HTML and CSS so that the website is not only functional but looks good and is styled well. Visual Studio did this very well and you could like the two languages with just a couple lines of code. Trello was also very useful and although there are many apps like it i felt that trello was one of if not the best one available and therefore both applications where very appropriate.
            </p>
    <h2 class="headings">2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change? </h2>
    <p class="text">I feel that my final project turned out very well everything works and no errors occur in future i would maybe change the theme of my website as it could be seen as quite boring but on the other hand I do like the simplicity and sleek look of my current theme. My colour changing padding stands out well but it looks a little takey. One thing i think i did very well is all my links and buttons they look great with animations and pictures and the code behind them is somewhat complex. The links to other websites that give more information on certain questions and a link to the code nation webpage at the bottom of each page. The logo in the top left also is a link that sends you back to the home page which makes everything more accessible. It is important to test and review your website using the mind of a user. This will show you what needs fixing/improving you can also get other people to assess your website and give advice i did this often and it was very helpful.
        </p>
    <h2 class="headings">2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h2>
    <p class="text">Improvement’s I would  like to incorporate the use of a framework such as angular or react as well as implement javascript or jquery to further adorn my website with exciting effects such as animations, transitions and games. I would also improve the style of my website and alter the aesthetic to improve the user experience.
        </p>
    <h2 class="headings">2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</h2>
    <p class="text">In order for my website to reach the requirements I had to review it and ensure that it meets the brief i did this by comparing the specific points, I had other people check over my work as well to ensure I had not missed any of the requirements needed. After final inspection i haven’t missed any of the key requirements.
